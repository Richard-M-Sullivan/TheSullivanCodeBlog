What is the problem - I want to be able to record the screen.

[ ] I want to use a hotkey to start and stop recording the screen
[ ] I want to optionally specify a region of the screen to record with the
    mouse
[ ] I want to optionally specify if I want to record sound or not
[ ] I want to optionally specify if I want to record video or not
[ ] I want to optionally specify the file that I want to save to


how does the command work?

I think that it should be a terminal command - I use flags to determine what
setting that I want - audio, video, area to capture. After specifying flags I
should be able to then use a combination of the mouse and hot keys to select an
area to record and to start and stop recording.

What does the commnad look like

         record computer sound
                    |   record microphone audio
                    |              |    specify recording area
                    |              |               |      record a gif
                    |              |               |            |   file name
                    |              |               |            |       |
record-screen [-s|--sound] [-m|--microphone] [-r|--region] [-g|--gif] [file]

By default the command will record the screen and wait for you to press the
hotkey to start recording, and press the hotkey to stop recording

SOUND and MICROPHONE and GIF and FILE do not change the operation
of the commnad

REGION changes the operation to waiting for the hotkey and then two mouse
clicks to get position. then it will wait for the hotkey to start and hotkey to
finish.

The first step is to parse the command line arguments

there are not any arguments that need a list of options, so this should be
easy - just look for flags, and then look for a single non-flag argument


get a list of arguments and the number of arguments, then iterate through and
set flags in the program.

based on the flags we compose a ffmpeg command
